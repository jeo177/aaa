## ü¶∏ Contributing to Roboflow Notebooks

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Roboflow Notebooks as easy and transparent as possible.

- When creating new notebook, make sure to use our [template](https://github.com/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/_train-template.ipynb) as starting point. It contains all the elements that we would like to include in our notebooks from now on.
- When adding or editing notebooks, make sure to specify the versions of pip packages üì¶ you are using.

Please keep in mind that repository is still under construction üöß. We will add more contribution guidelines soon.

## Submitting a Bug Report üêõ

If you spot a problem with Roboflow Notebooks, please submit a Bug Report!

For us to start investigating a possible problem we need to be able to reproduce it ourselves first. We've created a few
short guidelines below to help you provide what we need in order to get started.

When asking a question, people will be better able to provide help if you provide **code** that they can easily
understand and use to **reproduce** the problem. This is referred to by community members as creating
a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Your code that reproduces
the problem should be:

- ‚úÖ **Minimal** ‚Äì Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem
- ‚úÖ **Complete** ‚Äì Provide **all** parts someone else needs to reproduce your problem in the question itself
- ‚úÖ **Reproducible** ‚Äì Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem

In addition to the above requirements, for the [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) team to provide assistance your code
should be:

- ‚úÖ **Current** ‚Äì Verify that your code is up-to-date with current
  GitHub [main](https://github.com/roboflow/notebooks/tree/main), and if necessary `git pull` or `git clone` a new
  copy to ensure your problem has not already been resolved by previous commits.
- ‚úÖ **Unmodified** ‚Äì Your problem must be reproducible without any modifications to the codebase in this
  repository. [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) does not provide support for custom code ‚ö†Ô∏è. If custom code has been added, please post in the Community Forum for more assistance: https://discuss.roboflow.com

If you believe your problem meets all of the above criteria, please close this issue and raise a new one using the üêõ
**Bug Report** [template](https://github.com/roboflow/notebooks/issues/new/choose) and providing
a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to help us better
understand and diagnose your problem.
